# Notes for Christy

## Winston

### Food

- Winston typically eats **twice per day**
- Usually around 12:00 noon and 12:00 midnight, but this can be adjusted of course
- Each meal consists of **one can** of wet food or **one scoop** (1/4 cup) of dry food
- Wet food is on the floor in the corner
- Put wet food on a small plate so it’s easy to eat
- Dry food is in the high cabinet above the sink (make sure not to use the dog food!)
- He normally eats all wet food, all the time, but we leave out the appropriate amount of dry food (enough for each meal missed) when we’ll be away
- You can put the dry food in a metal bowl, or put it in his blue plastic egg as a game
- Refresh water bowls when you get a chance. He doesn’t usually drink it when we are going all wet food, but whenever we feed him dry I catch him taking some sips
- Please try to stop by at least three to four times before we come back on **Sunday night, June 11**. Thanks!

### Litterbox

- Please keep the litterbox scooped whenever you’re around <3
- I usually scoop it at least once per day, so he’s used to it being pretty clean most of the time
- We scoop into the Litter Genie, the weird gray bin in the bathroom. It keeps all the smells contained
- To use Litter Genie:
  1. Open top
  2. Scoop waste into bag in top compartment
  3. Close top
  4. Pull black handle straight outwards (this opens a trap door inside, letting the waste fall into the lower compartment)
  5. Release handle
- I think I somehow messed up loading the Litter Genie this time, so there’s two layers of bags and it’s a little harder to get the poop to drop all the way down. Please check that it is sealed away, or you will regret it next time you open it… haha

## The Apartment

### Wi-Fi

- Network: **Orion-Guest**
- Password: **poetic-rely-cajole**

### Electricity

- Sorry for the two-prong outlets. Our wiring is a bit old. If you need three, just use one of our power strips.
- Also, if a circuit blows (this has only happened to us when running microwave and A/C at the same time) the panel to reset is in the hallway right outside the door to our apartment. Push a button for a fuse to reset it.

### Fire Alarm

- This has not been a problem recently, but in case it goes off (it’s VERY LOUD):
- First make sure there is no fire or smoke anywhere
- Then you can silence it at the panel all the way downstairs pressing SILENCE and using code 1111.
- **Do not press RESET!**

### Thermostat

- The thermostat is only used for heat. Keep it turned all the way down
- You can use the air conditioners in each room but makes sure to turn them off when you leave
- The A/C in the living room has a remote (currently attached to the top)
- It gets kinda hot. I tend to keep the blinds drawn during the day to stop the sun from heating it up worse, but if you find the dark depressing feel free to open them
- There are two box fans that help a lot when it’s not too humid (one in the study, one in the bathroom, move them wherever you want)

### Parking

- I forgot to leave out the pass for you, but I **think** it is in my left desk drawer (white desk in the study)
- If it’s not in there, let me know and I will try to help
- With your temporary pass, you can park between signs that have a **Zone 25** sticker (a lot of them say **10/25,** which is also fine) and ignore the hourly limits. Just remember to avoid driveways, hydrants, handicap zones, private towing signs, etc.
- **Avoid Front Street for parking.** There are a lot of hard-to-see private spots that will get you towed.
- I can just about always find a spot either on my block of Howard St, or on Mascher St one block to the west. If you‘re really having trouble, check Hancock, Thompson, and Girard. There’s also a free lot at Thompson St and Frankford Ave

### SEPTA

- If you feel like taking an adventure to Old City, Center City, or University City (wow, a lot of our neighborhoods have "City" in the name), you can take the Market–Frankford ("el") at Girard station
- There’s a new fare system called SEPTA Key
- You can get a card at the machine at Girard and load it with cash or credit card, and then later you can reload it at the machine or online
- There are passes, but what you probably want is called **Travel Wallet**
- Here’s a decent video about how to get it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wa8L4Yem1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wa8L4Yem1I)
- Once you have a card, you just tap it on a red screens at the turnstile and go in
- The side of the tracks when you first walk in from Girard is the train you want (westbound towards 69th)
- When you come home, take eastbound to Frankford
- Sorry if some of this is obvious

### TV

- The TV remote says Vizio on it.
- For streaming, etc, use the **Fire TV.** The remote has a microphone button on top.
- Fire TV is similar to Roku. We have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, and HBO Now. You can search for shows/movies or open apps by holding down the microphone button and speaking.
- You can also use the Wii U or Blu-ray player if you want. Blu-ray remote says Sony on it.
- Apple TV is not currently hooked up but it does pretty much the same things as Fire TV.

## Thanks!
